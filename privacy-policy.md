Privacy Policy â€“ NowTT

Effective Date: 18.09.2025

We ("NowTT" or "the App") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how long we keep it, and what rights you have under applicable laws (such as GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and other privacy regulations).

1. Information We Collect

Class Selection
Your selected school type and class are stored on your device.
If you enable notifications, your class selection is also stored securely in our database together with your device token, so we can send you the correct timetable updates.

Timetable Data
The app retrieves timetable information from the Heinrich-Kleyer-Schule official website. This data is fetched in read-only mode and is not altered by us.

Device Tokens (for Notifications)
When you enable notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google) generates an anonymous device token. This token, along with your class selection, is stored securely in our database for notification delivery.

Technical Data
When you use the app, certain technical information may be collected automatically by our servers or third-party services (e.g., Firebase), such as:

IP address

Device model and operating system

Error logs and crash reports

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above to:

Deliver timetable updates and notifications.

Ensure service reliability and improve the app.

Detect, prevent, and resolve technical issues.

We do not sell your data, use it for targeted advertising, or share it with third parties other than our service providers (see Section 5).
